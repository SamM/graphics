## Explorations of space and colour

### Working Examples

These examples are ordered based on when they were added to the repository respectively.

- [RGB Clock Dark](https://rawgit.com/SamM/graphics/master/rgb-clock.html) - I came up with the proportions of each segment of time and presented the final arrangement in this clock.
- [RGB Clock Light](https://rawgit.com/SamM/graphics/master/rgb-clock.html?invert=true) - Here is the same clock with inverted colours.

- [Binary Division Calculator](https://rawgit.com/SamM/graphics/master/binary-division-test.html) - I started thinking about dividing distances in halves to find any point along the spectrum...

- [Circles Exploration](https://rawgit.com/SamM/graphics/master/Circles.html) - Drawing circles using the 2D Context and the arc tool.

- [Graphics Library](https://rawgit.com/SamM/graphics/master/graphics.html) - An exploration of different data-structures such as Points and collections of points (Shapes).

- [Drawing with the Graphics Library](https://rawgit.com/SamM/graphics/master/Drawing.html) - Using the Drawing class from the Graphics Library to render Points and Shapes to a canvas.

- [Drawing with the Graphics Library & WebGL](https://rawgit.com/SamM/graphics/master/WebGLDrawing.html) - Using the WebGL class from the Graphics Library to render Points and Shapes to a canvas.
