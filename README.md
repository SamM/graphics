## Explorations of space and colour

### Working Examples

- [RGB Clock Dark](https://github.com/SamM/graphics/blob/master/rgb-clock.html?raw=true) - I came up with the proportions of each segment of time and presented the final arrangement in this clock.

- [Binary Division Calculator](https://github.com/SamM/graphics/blob/master/binary-division-test.html?raw=true) - I started thinking about dividing distances in halves to find any point along the spectrum...

### There is more to come

I am currently working on more examples to add to this section and will eventually present the findings in a blog format.
